	<h1>Materia playing cards</h1>
	<h2>About:</h2><p>As a hack day project, I took a card back design I previously came up with for a Materia<a href="https://materia.ucf.edu/" target="_new"><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a> widget I worked on and pushed it to the next level. For one day, I worked on developing 'Kogneato' (Materia's iconic robot) into various royal cards and of course, the joker. From there, a coworker had the cards printed and the idea had come to reality!
