	<h2>About:</h2><p>I had the pleasure of working with The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society to plan, produce, edit and package the introductory video for their 2015 Man and Woman of the Year Gala. The video features not only the candidates running, but the boy and girl of the year as well. Being the producer in this role, I coordinated with the senior campaign manager to film interviews. Beyond that, I set up and filmed the footage myself, and did all post-production on the package. The video took about 2 weeks with part-time schedule from initial concept to final product.<b>Polar Plunge</b><a href="http://www.wftv.com/news/events/fundraisers/special-olympics-polar-plunge/njYTw/" target="_new"><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>. </p>
