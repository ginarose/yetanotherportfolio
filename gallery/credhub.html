	<h2>About:</h2><p>This Badges at UCF poster was a collaboration effort between myself and three other coworkers at the University of Central Florida. While I played a very small part in the development of CredHub, I designed a poster (right) for the team to take to the 2014 New Media Conference in Portland, Oregon. I also made handouts (left) for interested parties to take with them at the showcase.</p>
	<h2>Tool(s) used:</h2> <p>Adobe Illustrator</p>
