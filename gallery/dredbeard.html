	<h1>Dredbeard Landing Page designs</h1>
	<h2>About:</h2><p>The University of Central Florida Center for Distributed Learning recently underwent a internal software overhaul. Our timelogging and request ticketing system, the Dredbeard suite, was massively updated. I was in charge of coming up with ideas for a new landing page that links all the tools for internal use. I brainstormed closely with a coworker, Elise Heron, to come up with usable and creative ideas. To see other options we came up with, view this <a href="../imgs/gallery/dredbeard_options.pdf" target="_new">PDF <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>. </p>
	<h2>Tool(s) used:</h2> <p>Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, pen &amp; paper.</p>
