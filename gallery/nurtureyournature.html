	<h1>Earth Day mixed media</h1>
	<h2>About:</h2><p>For earth day, I wanted to do a play on words with the traditional saying of "Nature vs. Nurture," and came up with this. It's a bit of a mixed media project in that I digitally and traditionally lettered words, used some typography and combined it with my photography. I enjoy doing quick daily exercises with handlettering and using art as a vehicle for words that I find endearing or inspirational.</p>
	<h2>Tool(s) used:</h2> <p>Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, Canon 60D, acrylic paint, and a font called <a href="www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Salaryman">Salaryman</a></p>
