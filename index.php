  <div class="pure-u-sm-1 pure-u-md-2-3"><p class="about-text">My name is Gina Piscitelli, or Gina Rose for short. I see you've stumbled upon my portfolio page. Welcome! Here you'll find a visual representation of my work as a digital media connoisseur. I enjoy fiddling with code as well as dabbling in design work. The examples you'll find around my portfolio showcase my latest works, as well as the portfolio itself.</p></div>

    <h3>Experience</h3>
    <h4><i class="fa fa-terminal"></i> Languages</h4>
    <p>Besides the basic <b>HTML/CSS</b> familiarity, I'm also competent with making markup semantic for <b>508 compliance</b> (accessibility for everyone is important to me!) I've also got <b>javascript</b> experience in my pocket to make features exciting (including jQuery, Coffeescript, and AngularJS frameworks.)</p>
    <h4><i class="fa fa-camera"></i> Equipment</h4>
    <p>In the past, I've used <b>Canon digital SLR</b> cameras and Panasonic handheld camcorders, but can easily adapt to new camera setups. I'm more than familiar with studio lighting and audio. <b>Mac and Windows</b> compete for my affection, as I'm efficient and use both.</p>
    <h4><i class="fa fa-desktop"></i> Software</h4>
    <p>You name it, I've probably used it. I often find myself using the <b>Adobe suite</b> (I'm familiar with just about all of the programs) however, I have used Sony Vegas and Final Cut. My ideal web development IDE is <b>SublimeText</b> (Monokai theme for me!) and use <b><a href="https://github.com/ginarose">Git</a></b> actively.</p>

    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
    <h4><i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i> Learning new things</h4>
    <p>I enjoy exploring new technology, especially if it's something in the creative field. </p>
    <h4><i class="fa fa-desktop"></i> Beauty blogging and nail art</h4>
    <p>Over the past few years, I have taken my love for pretty things to a whole new level: to my nailbeds. Not your typical kind of "artwork," I find <b>nail art</b> to be relaxing and allows me to be creative without having to go full-scale like painting on an 11"x14" canvas. </p>
    <p>Along with this, I also <b>run a blog</b> that has gotten me a few really interesting complimentary things. Food, nail stamping plates, and beauty products are among the things that I've reviewed at twinklefarts.com</p>
    <h4><i class="fa fa-desktop"></i> Seeing the world</h4>
    <p>It's been a goal of mine to <b>travel</b> as much as possible, and I make it a priority to do so. My next destination? <b>Italy</b>.</p>
