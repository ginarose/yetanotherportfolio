Here you'll find a <b>visual representation</b> of my work as a digital media connoisseur. Born and raised in Florida, I had the ability to attend the <b>University of Central Florida</b>, where I refined my love for all things digital and interesting. I enjoy fiddling with <b>code</b> as well as dabbling in <b>design</b> work, among other hobbies. The examples you'll find around my portfolio showcase my latest works, as well as the portfolio itself.</p>

    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
    <h4><i class="fa info-icon fa-2x fa-lightbulb-o"></i> Learning new things</h4>
    <p>I enjoy exploring new technology, especially if it's something in the creative field. On most weekends, you'll find me picking up new programs and learning as much as I can about them on my own.</p>
    <h4><i class="fa info-icon fa-2x fa-eye"></i> Beauty blogging and nail art</h4>
    <p>Over the past few years, I have taken my love for pretty things to a whole new place: to my nailbeds. While not your typical kind of "artwork," I find <b>nail art</b> to be relaxing and allows me to be creative without having to go full-scale like painting on an 11"x14" canvas. </p>
    <p>Along with this, I also <a href="http://www.twinklefarts.me/" target="_new"><b>run a blog</b><i class="fa fa-external-link fa-small"></i></a> that has gotten me a few really interesting complimentary things. Food, nail stamping plates, and beauty products are among the things that I've reviewed at twinklefarts.com</p>
    <h4><i class="fa info-icon fa-2x fa-globe"></i> Seeing the world</h4>
    <p>It's been a goal of mine to <b>travel</b> as much as possible, and I make it a priority to do so. My next destination? <b>Italy</b>.</p>
